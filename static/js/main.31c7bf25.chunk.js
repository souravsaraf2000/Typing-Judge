Thus, it is taken by people who live in the Himalaya Mountains, but not nearly so much by those who live in the plains of India. Alcohol is not necessary in any way to anybody. The regular use of alcohol, even in small quantities, tends to cause mischief in many ways to various organs of the body. It affects the liver, it weakens the mental powers, and lessens the general energy of the body. In addition damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from chronic alcohol abuse.","The bird I like most is the parrot. The parrot is a very beautiful bird.

The great advantage of early rising is the good start it gives us in our day\u2019s work. In the early morning the mind is fresh and there are few sounds so that work done at that time is generally well done. The early riser also finds time to take some exercise in the fresh morning air, and\u201a this exercise supplies him with a fund of energy that will last until the evening. By beginning so early, he knows that he has plenty of time to do thorough all the work he can be expected to do, and is not tempted to hurry over any part of it. All his working being finished in good time, he has a long interval of rest in the evening before he goes to bed.","Summer vacations were going to start and we had started to plan where to go. Me and my brother were very excited. My father did all the necessary arrangements such as travelling tickets, accomodation, type of food we will have etc. We decided to go to Jaipur. We set off for the railway station at around 06.00 p.m. and boarded the train at 06.30 p.m. We reached Jaipur the next morning. We went to our hotel, had breakfast and in the evening took our tour bus of the Department of Tourism for visiting the sights. Our first destination was the museum. After seeing the museum, the bus took us to the palace Hawa Mahal and Jantar Mantar. The next day we proceeded to Amer Fort and our last destination was Lakshmi Narayan Temple. Everyday we used to see many places in Jaipur. We also went to see the handicraft festival. On Saturday, it was time for us to leave but none of us wanted to go back, but we had to go. We returned home and told our friends about the excursion. This was a very exciting excursion indeed!","Test Paragraph"],e.clearTextBox=function(){document.getElementById("textBox").value="",e.setState({disabled:!0,error:!1,startTime:"",accuracy:0,flag:0})},e.paragraphAllotment=function(){var t=Math.floor(6*Math.random());t===e.state.paraNo&&(0===t?t=1:4===t?t=3:t+=1);var a=e.paragraphTexts[t];e.setState({para:a,paraNo:t}),e.clearTextBox()},e.countWords=function(e){return e.split(" ").length},e.changeFunc=function(t){var a=t.target.value.length;0===e.state.flag&&e.setState({startTime:new Date}),a>0?e.setState({disabled:!1}):e.setState({disabled:!0});var n=e.state.para.slice(0,a);t.target.value!==n?e.setState({error:!0,enteredPara:t.target.value}):e.setState({error:!1,enteredPara:t.target.value}),e.setState({flag:1})},e.result=function(){var t=e.state.enteredPara.split(" "),a=e.state.para.split(" "),n=e.countWords(e.state.enteredPara),r=e.countWords(e.state.para),s=0;if(n>r)return alert("Extra Words Typed !!!"),-1;if(n<r)return alert("Some words are missing !!!"),-1;for(var o=0;o<n;o++)t[o]!==a[o]&&(s+=1);var i=n-s,c=i/n*100;c=c.toFixed(2);var l=(new Date-e.state.startTime)/1e3/60;e.setState({accuracy:c,correctCount:i,incorrectCount:s,wpm:Math.floor(n/l)})},e.clickEvent=function(){e.setState({show:"none"})},e}return Object(c.a)(a,[{key:"componentDidMount",value:function(){this.paragraphAllotment()}},{key:"render",value:function(){return Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"App",children:[Object(d.jsx)(m,{disp:this.state.show,click:this.clickEvent}),Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"main-content",style:"none"===this.state.show?{display:"block"}:{display:"none"},children:[Object(d.jsx)("h1",{children:"Typing Judge"}),Object(d.jsx)(u,{para:this.state.para}),Object(d.jsx)("button",{className:"btn btn-info",onClick:this.paragraphAllotment,children:"Change Paragraph"}),Object(d.jsx)(p,{changeFunc:this.changeFunc,error:this.state.error}),Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"button-div",children:[Object(d.jsx)("button",{className:"btn btn-secondary marginRight",onClick:this.clearTextBox,style:this.state.disabled?{cursor:"not-allowed"}:{cursor:"pointer"},disabled:this.state.disabled,children:"Reset"}),Object(d.jsx)("button",{className:"btn btn-success",style:{cursor:"pointer"},onClick:this.result,children:"Check"})]}),this.state.accuracy?Object(d.jsx)(b,{incorrect:this.state.incorrectCount,correct:this.state.correctCount,count:this.countWords(this.state.para),accuracy:this.state.accuracy,wpm:this.state.wpm}):""]})]})}}]),a}(n.Component),y=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&a.e(3).then(a.bind(null,20)).then((function(t){var a=t.getCLS,n=t.getFID,r=t.getFCP,s=t.getLCP,o=t.getTTFB;a(e),n(e),r(e),s(e),o(e)}))};o.a.render(Object(d.jsx)(r.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(d.jsx)(g,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),y()}],[[19,1,2]]]);
